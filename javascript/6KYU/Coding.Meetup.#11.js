/*
You will be given a sequence of objects representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

Given the following input array:

var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Maria', lastName: 'Y.', country: 'Cyprus', continent: 'Europe', age: 30, language: 'Java' },
  { firstName: 'Victoria', lastName: 'T.', country: 'Puerto Rico', continent: 'Americas', age: 70, language: 'Python' },
];
write a function that returns the average age of developers (rounded to the nearest integer). In the example above your function should return 50 (number).

Notes:

The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.
Age is represented by a number which can be any positive integer.




This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex.

const getAverageAge = list => {
    const totalAge = list.reduce((acc, developer) => acc + developer.age, 0)
    const averageAge = totalAge / list.length
    return Math.round(averageAge)
}

// Another Solution
const getAverageAge2 = list => Math.round(list.reduce((acc, developer) => acc + developer.age, 0) / list.length)
